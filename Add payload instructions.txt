The following tasks are required to add a new payload:

1. Create a new file with the payload in json format and place under relevant sub-folder in \jsondata\ root directory, i.e.

  - new.json will look like the output below
  - any values encompassed {{ }} will be replaced from excel run sheet based on the column name

{
    "fvTenant": {
        "attributes": {
            "dn": "uni/tn-{{tn_name}}",
            "name": "{{tn_name}}",
            "descr": "{{description}}",
            "status": "{{action}}"
        }
    }
}

2. Create a new entry under launcher.json for the new payload, i.e.

	"new_command": {
		"json_folder": "FabTnPol",
		"script_msg": "Push xxxx configuration",
		"json_uri": "mo/uni/tn-{tn_name}",
		"table_name": "TABLE_NEW",
		"json_file": "new.json",
		"mandatory_keys": [
			"action",
			"tn_name"],
		"default_values": {
		"example1": "default_value",
		"example2": "default_value"}		
		}
	},

Note. Make sure to replace the values with the relevant information, i.e.
  - json_folder: the sub directory under the jsondata\ folder that the payload is located
  - json_file: the exact filename that contains the payload
  - json_uri: the uri that the payload needs to be pushed to
  - script_msg: msg that appear in excel when this payload is pushed
  - table_name: name of the table in the excel run sheet that has the values
  - mandatory_keys: what column names are mandatory for the row to be considered valid
  - default_values: default values for non-mandatory columns

3. Create a new table in the excel runsheet, i.e.
  - Select the relevant worksheet, i.e. Tenant_Policies
  - Create a new table using an existing table as an example
  - Select the table range (starting from status_code as top left cell) and give it a name, i.e. TABLE_NEW
  - Ensure the new table name is not already in use
  - Add as many columns as required, ensure they match with {{ }} values defined in step 1

4. Add a new button with the following macro:

  - Macro can be added by pressing Alt-F11
  - Goto Modules\Module1
  - Copy and paste the data below
  - Ensure the NewCmdName is changed to somethign relevant
  - Ensure the 'new_cmd' is changed to reflect the name of the comand, i.e. 'new_Command' as defined in step 2

Sub Push_NewCmdName_Button()
RunPython ("from aci import run_from_excel; run_from_excel('newcmd')")
End Sub


4. Update excel.py and add the table name, to existing table list, i.e.
  
  TABLE_TENANT_POLICIES = ['TABLE_NEW']
